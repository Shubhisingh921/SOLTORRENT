# SOL Torrent
# [Download App](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ngIqac-RW3cpfyQvApUVhhUeo4EiUvDS/view?usp=share_link)   
SOL torrent aims at providing an alternative to classic P2P sharing based on SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN


### Motive
Torrenting is a classic example of P2P file sharing.
Major issues with classic torrents are :
More copies of same data
Seeder vs Leecher Conflict
Security and legal inconfidence


### Feature of SolTorrent
- Solana Wallet Support, can approve through Solflare wallet, Phantom Wallet & Slope Wallet.
- The user can sign in using any Solana based wallet.
- The user can upload files, notes, pdf to the Solana blockchain.
- The uploaded content can be set as private or public.
- Each upload cost some SOLs and this ensures that the data stays forever on the blockchain.
- The links to the uploaded content can be shared to download via wallet transaction.

## Problem it Solves
- Removes Seeders and Leecher.
- No multiple copy of same data like classic torrents.
- More secure and accountable
- Files can be stored  on-chain directly via Solana Accounts.
- A specialized file chain, to drastically reduce the uploading cost. Links to those files are then maintained on chain.
- All the assets are encrypted by default using a key derived from a Solana Wallet.
- Minimalistic UX. Easy to access features. 

## Challenges we faced

- Implementing Devnet,localnet and testnet.
- Implementing a built-in note editor enables online notes edition.
- Installing anchor version.
- Deploying Smart contract.
- Integrating multiple solana wallets

## Proposed Enhancements
- Curated database of contents on solana blockchain 
- Provide liquidity to SOL torrents and earn fees
- P2P trades
- Schedule origin tracking for contents
